## Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Test API Endpoints

#### Check API Status
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api
```

#### Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health
```

#### Check Content Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/content
```

### 2. Test the Application Flow

1. **Open the app**: https://your-app.vercel.app
2. **Complete onboarding**:
   - Select genres (e.g., romance, thriller)
   - Select duration preference
   - Click "Generate My Recommendations"
3. **Verify recommendations** appear
4. **Test search** functionality
5. **Test category filtering**

### 3. Check Vercel Function Logs

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click on "Functions" tab
4. Click on `api/index.ts`
5. View the logs for any errors

## Debugging Common Issues
